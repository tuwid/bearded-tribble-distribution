	A fair distribution algorithm in python to spread different services with different weights in different nodes  

	I had this problem some days ago while designign my new monitoring system
	we have X service to monitor and each of them has a specific weight to monitor
	weight as in how much CPU/Network/IO would spend to monitor and the number of service had to be eavenly distributed in N servers that would server as monitors so I wrote a solution for my problem and thought it might come in help somebody
